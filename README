Movie Review Classification
- Implementation a Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch
By Dhanush Thotadur Divakara

To run the training file:

	python nbtrain.py [training directory] [model file]
The training directory should be in the same directory as nbtrain.py and the same goes with the model file

To run the test file:
	
	python nbtest.py [model file] [test directory] [predictions file]

The test directory should contain all the files and not contain a subdirectory. So to run the development files, copy pos and neg folders to the same directory as nbtest.py


logratiopos file has the log ratio of positive to negative term weights for top 20 terms sorted in descending order. The log base is 2.

logrationeg file has the log ratio of negative to positive term weights for top 20 terms sorted in descending order. The log base is 2.

predictionsfiletest contains the filenames, positive and negative probabilities (log probabilities) for test data

No of positive reviews : 90 
No of Negative reviews :110 
Pos percentage :45.0 
neg percentage :55.0

predictionsfilepos contains the filenames , positive and negative probabilities (log probabilities) for pos folder in dev (development data - positive reviews)
Accuracy for positive reviews in dev data is 75% i.e it classifies 75% of the positive reviews correctly

predictionsfileneg contains the filenames , positive and negative probabilities (log probabilities) for neg folder in dev (development data - negative reviews)
Accuracy for negative reviews in dev data is 80% i.e it classifies 80% of the negative reviews correctly

Percentage for correct classification in development data: 77.5%
